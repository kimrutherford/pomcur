    <p>
      If there is any information in your paper which you could not capture in
      the curation tool, please describe the data briefly, as the
      curators may be able to include it in the database.
    </p>
    <p>
      Examples include:
      <ul>
      <li> multi-gene phenotypes
      <li> substrates of gene products (e.g. protein substrates of kinases or protein transporters)
      <li> "targets" of localization dependencies (e.g. gene A localizes gene B) 
      <li> cell cycle phases when a process occurs (during)
      <li> specific residues modified in annotated protein modifications (e.g. phosphorylated on residue S45)
      <li> protein domain data or other protein sequence features
      <li> missing gene names (synonyms)
      <li> transcriptional regulation (of the WT allele - transcriptional changes due to mutations can be captured in the tool)
      <li> complementation data (whether the pombe gene complements a homologue in a different organism or vice versa; complementation may be full, partial or absent)
      <li> gene product name updates
      <li> human or budding yeast orthologs
      </ul>
      Most of these annotation-types will be handled in future releases of the
      curation tool.
